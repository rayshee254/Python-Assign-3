**Calculate Discount**
This Python script provides a function calculate_discount that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.

**Features**
The calculate_discount function takes two parameters:
price: The original price of the item.
discount_percent: The discount percentage.
If the discount percentage is 20% or higher, the function applies the discount and returns the final price.
If the discount percentage is less than 20%, the function returns the original price without applying any discount.
The script prompts the user to enter the original price of the item and the discount percentage, then prints the final price after applying the discount (or the original price if no discount was applied).
**Usage**
Run the Python script.
Enter the original price of the item when prompted.
Enter the discount percentage when prompted.
The script will print the final price after applying the discount (or the original price if no discount was applied).
